Note from alankila, 18.9.2010:

I'm gradually considering sidplay2 codebase to be obsolete. I am officially
abandoning this project today.

I'm primarily working on jsidplay2, which has now also been integrated to
Acid64 via jsiddevice, a SID emulator on the other end of a network socket,
which is basically a minimalistic jsidplay2 as well. The java project is
strongly recommend for checking out, as it has video output, cartride, disk and
tape support in addition to SID playing capabilities.

This codebase has a variety of bugs in CPU and with its headless VIC emulation.
These bugs are unlikely to ever get fixed, due to the lipstick-on-a-pig feeling
that it evokes. (The Java codebase has rewritten CPU and VIC.) Hoever, it is of
note that someone ported our port of VICE's MOS6526 into this codebase, so that
is now fairly good and is expected to pass the Lorentz test suite. So people
who want to work on a sidplay2 are encouraged to pick the mos6526.cpp from this
tree.

In short, use jsidplay2, or acic64+jsiddevice, or VICE's vsid. I know the vsid
is right now horribly primitive, but I'm pretty sure a superior SID player
can be evolved from VICE with less effort than it takes to upgrade the CPU and
VIC of sidplay2, and to perhaps fix other small problems.

See you in VICE, or the land of Java.

Addition from Leandro "drfiemost" Nini, 28/09/2010

As Antti Lankila switched his focus on other projects from now on I'll keep
maintaining (lib)sidplay2.
Following Antti's suggestions I started by integrating VICE's version of
resid-fp to make easy porting fixes, with the effect of switching the output
back from float to 16 bit signed integers.
Since I'm developing my own music player my interest in sidplay (the executable)
is limited so I'll try to keep it in sync with changes to the library but it
may be broken from time to time.

Update - 17/10/2010

The current trunk now contains the resid-fp engine aligned with the VICE's
version and should be in a usable state.
The resid-builder branch adds a new builder based on the original reSID code,
with some fixes from VICE, beside the residfp one. It still need some working
on filter loading because the two engines uses different filter format.

The Windows build files and the spec files are most likey broken,
fixes are welcome.
