=head1 NAME

sidplayfp.ini - Configuration file for L<sidplayfp(1)>.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This page describes the options available for the configuration file of
Sidplayfp.  It is composed by a number of sections, each one composed
by a section  name, enclosed by square brackets, followed by a list of
<parameter>=<value> lines.

B<sidplayfp.ini> supports the following sections:

B<[SIDPlayfp]> - Generic configuration

B<[Console]> - Console appearance configuration

B<[Audio]> - Audio output configuration

B<[Emulation]> - Emulation engine parameters

All options and values are described in detail below.

For any of the following parameter, if it's specified more than one
time the last entry encountered will be used.

B<NOTE>: if any of these options is specified outside its section, it will
be I<ignored>.

=item B<Version>=I<< <number> >>

Configuration version

=item B<Songlength Database>=I<< <path> >>

Path for the Songlength DB.  Should point to the F<DOCUMENTS/Songlengths.txt>
file under the HVSC collection path.
On *NIX systems if this value is not set, L<sidplayfp(1)> will try
F<$PREFIX/share/sidplayfp/Songlengths.txt>.

=item B<Default Play Length>=I<mm:ss>

Default play time if Songlength Database is not found.

=item B<Default Record Length>=I<mm:ss>

Default recording time when writing wave files if Songlength Database is not found.

=item B<Kernal Rom>=I<< <path> >>

Full path for the Kernal Rom file. This is the most important rom and should always be provided, although many tunes will still work without.
By default the program will look for a F<kernal> file under the following locations:

=over

=item * $XDG_DATA_HOME/sidplayfp/

on *NIX systems where XDG_DATA_HOME is defined.

=item * $HOME/.local/share/sidplayfp/

on *NIX systems where XDG_DATA_HOME is not defined.

=item * $PREFIX/share/sidplayfp

on *NIX systems when not found in the above directories.

=item * %CSIDL_APPDATA%\\sidplayfp\\

on Windows systems where CSIDL_APPDATA is defined.

=item * %USERPROFILE%\\Application Data\\sidplayfp\\

on Windows systems where CSIDL_APPDATA is not defined.

=item B<Basic Rom>=I<< <path> >>

Full path for the Basic Rom file. This is mostly useful for playing BASIC tunes.
By default the program will look for a F<basic> file under the same locations as above.

=item B<Chargen Rom>=I<< <path> >>

Full path for the Character generator Rom file. Almost useless for playback of tunes, but included for completeness.
By default the program will look for a F<chargen> file under the same locations as above.

=head2 Console

=over

=item B<Ansi>=I<true|false>

Use ANSI escape sequences to provide colored output.

=item B<Char Top Left>=I<< <char> >>

Character for the top left corner.

=item B<Char Top Right>=I<< <char> >>

Character for the top right corner.

=item B<Char Bottom Left>=I<< <char> >>

Character for the bottom left corner.

=item B<Char Bottom Right>=I<< <char> >>

Character for the bottom right corner.

=item B<Char Vertical>=I<< <char> >>

Character for vertical lines.

=item B<Char Horizontal>=I<< <char> >>

Character for horizontal lines.

=item B<Char Junction Left>=I<< <char> >>

Character for left junctions.

=item B<Char Junction Right>=I<< <char> >>

Character for right junctions.

=head2 Audio

=over

=item B<Frequency>=I<< <number> >>

Playback frequency expressed in Hertz. Default is 48000.

=item B<Channels>=I<< <number> >>

Number of channels, 1 for mono and 2 for stereo playback Default is 1.

=item B<BitsPerSample>=I<< <16|32> >>

Number of bits ber sample, used only for wav output. Using
values other than the ones specified will produce invalid
output.

=head2 Emulation

=over

=item B<Engine>=I<< <RESIDFP|RESID|HARDSID|EXSID|NONE> >>

Set the SID emulation engine. Default is RESIDFP.

=item B<C64Model>=I<< <PAL|NTSC|OLD_NTSC|DREAN> >>

Default c64 model to use if not specified by tune, PAL for
european PAL-B model, NTSC for american/japanese NTSC-M models,
OLD_NTSC for NTSC-M models with old video chip and DREAN
for argentinian PAL-N model. Default is PAL.

=item B<ForceC64Model>=I<true|false>

Force the configured c64 model even if the tune specifies one.

=item B<SidModel>=I<< <MOS6581|MOS8580> >>

Default SID chip model, old MOS 6581 or newer MOS 8580.

=item B<ForceSidModel>=I<true|false>

Force the configured SID chip model even if the tune specifies one.

=item B<UseFilter>=I<true|false>

Enable/disable the emulation of the SID filter.

=item B<FilterBias>=I<< <number> >>

Controls the filter bias in the ReSID emulation.  The bias is
given in millivolts, and a maximum reasonable control range is
approximately -500 to 500, the default value is 0.

=item B<FilterCurve6581>=I<< <number> >>

Controls the filter curve for the 6581 model in the ReSIDfp
emulation.  Ranges from 0.0 (light) to 1.0 (dark), the default
value is 0.5.

=item B<FilterCurve8580>=I<< <number> >>

Controls the filter curve for the 8580 model in the ReSIDfp
emulation.  Value is expressed in Hertz and the default is 12500.
