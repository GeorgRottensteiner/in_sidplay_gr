Nullsoft DSP Effects Plug-in 0.35 for Winamp
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This plug-in lets you use the following effects on
your sound in Winamp:

Echo: adds a simple echo effect to the music
Voice Removal: only for Stereo sounds, this attempts
  to remove the center channel. Sounds pretty good on
  about 1% of music out there, the other 99% sounds
  like crap :)
Pitch/Tempo control: ownage :)

Once you install this nugget, fire up Winamp, open 
up the preferences (CTRL+P), go to the Plugins/DSP&Effect
section, and select 'Nullsoft DSP Effects' as 
the new DPS Plug-in. You can then select from the three
above effects.

Limitations:
  This plug-in only effects audio that is 16 bit.
  Note that this plug-in won't work with passive plug-ins
  such as CD audio.
